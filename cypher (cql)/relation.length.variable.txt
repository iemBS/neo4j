Filter on variable length relationship
Notes:
  -Using variable-length paths that have the lower bound zero means that two variables can point to
the same node. If the path length between two nodes is zero, they are by definition the same node.
Note that when matching zero-length paths the result may contain a match even when matching on
a relationship type not in use.
Main Success Scenario
  1. Code below returns all movies related to "Charlie Sheen" by 1 to 3 hops
  
    MATCH (martin {name: 'Charlie Sheen'})-[:ACTED_IN*1..3]-(movie:Movie)
    RETURN movie.title
  1a. Use a variable 
    MATCH p = (actor {name: 'Charlie Sheen'})-[:ACTED_IN*2]-(co_actor)
    RETURN relationships(p)
  1b. Use a variable length where the lower bound is 0
    MATCH (wallstreet:Movie {title: 'Wall Street'})-[*0..1]-(x)
    RETURN x
